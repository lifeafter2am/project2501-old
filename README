This is a highly customized version of XMonad, running both dzen2 (with multiple patches) and conky-cli.  This setup is mostly designed around the use of the console, with only 2 possible layouts: ResizableTiled and Full.  ResizableTiled is what I use the most, as it provides lots of flexibility in both layout and in resizing.  

When the system boots up, you will be brought to a normal console login.  You should log in as the user below, and only su to root when needed.
